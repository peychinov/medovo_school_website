              Our purpose is the harmony and beauty in nature to infuse into the relationship between students and their teachers.
              <br>
              We dream to achieve, in collaboration with parents, the most difficult but also the most important task ever entrusted to the man –
              <br>
              to educate and teach the youth the Christian values so that they would become helpful members of the society -
              <br>
              young people who love the good, are moral and pure, honor the elderly and help those in need.
              <br>
              We would like to teach them not only to read and write but also to love as they have been loved - by their parents, teachers and classmates,
              <br>
              to succeed in life, finding paths to human hearts and giving out the love with which they themselves have been filled.
              <br>
              This would be the mission of "Beloved Child" school.

It stands at 50 km northwest of the city of Plovdiv and 60 km west of the city of Stara Zagora – far from the polluted air of the cities, from the noise and stress of the busy schedules.

                    <br>
                    There will be also flower alleys and ornamental trees - clean and pretty!

                  We are the Dombazyan family – members of the SDA Church in the village of Medovo. Motivated by the Bible and the Spirit of prophecy we left the city and with much prayer and God’s mercy we built our home and very soon the Lord motivated us to build a school. With God’s help and with the help of many brothers and sisters we continue to work for the salvation of our children.

                  We are the Petrovi family from the town of Ruse. At the end of 2014 we decided to adopt a child. Concerned about his education we started looking for a property in the nature and a school in which the child would be acquainted not only with the school curriculum but also with the Christian values. We prayed and God pointed us to the village of Medovo where such a school was being built. Since we found a proper home for ourselves in a neighboring village we settled here. We desire to help in the building of the school and in the process of education as my wife is a long-experienced  teacher who loves children and God.

                <p>
                  My name is Venica Angelova and I live in the city of Plovdiv. As a mother of three - my first two studying in state schools - I want to share my desire that my third child would study in the "Beloved Child" school.
                  <br>
                  There is a battle going on for the souls of our children and I see how they are attacked day after day by their surroundings in school, by the theories that they study their - and which go against our Christian beliefs. As a result their minds are confused - and this in the age when their value system is being built - it is not established yet as with us adults. We teach them the truth at home and when they go to school they are being taught lessons containing lies. Are we not thus putting our children in a trap? And then we ourselves suffer witnessing the results - what our children are tranforming into, how much they imitate the world and its customs! Is it worth risking their salvation?
                  <br>
                  Until now in Bulgaria we haven't had the privilege to have our children study in a school that lifts up God's principles. Are we going to take advantage of the rich blessings that God longs to bestow upon our children and upon us - their parents - through the "Beloved Child" school?

                  My name is Zhan Tachev. I am 53 years old, a member of the SDA Church in Plovdiv. With great joy God motivated me to take part in the establishment of the first school in Bulgaria governed by Adventists. God loves children and desires their salvation. It is of vital importance to protect them from the influence of the world and place them close to nature. Although my own children are already grown up I realize the need of such centers of education. I support this enterprise and believe that God also supports it with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. You can support it as well!

History
<br>
Twenty-five years ago some adventist families were inspired by God's word through the message about going out of the noisy, dirty and corrupt towns. So the second biggest city in Bulgaria named Plovdiv decreased its population with several families. This group of Adventists prayed earnestly and settled in a beautiful, pure and peaceful place. Surrounded with hills, rivers, forests and fields – listening to birds' songs instead of noisy cars, smelling the fragrance of roses and herbs instead of the smoke of factories and machines. They were closer to God's creation and far from human inventions. They faced a lot of challenges as Abraham has in his life. Trusting in God and by faith they left their fathers' home. Some of them later went back to the city, but most of them put the fundament of their new homes and a new life style – closer to God and to heaven. The village Medovo became their new home. Several native families were converted and so was founded the new church.
<br>
After 15 years the  history repeated itself. At the end of 2006 several young families were praying and looking around – just as the first ones. After one year of searching for a place and even paying deposits God closed all the other “doors” and pointed in a direction they didn't know. But God knew it – it was the village of Medovo. This place become a prayer requesting point and was examined by the young Adventist families. This process continues today as well. God moves them to study and they pray for God to use them in two directions – EDUCATION AND MEDICAL MISSIONARY WORK.
<br>
They have visited different SDA institutions where they could study. God has showed them how He can lead them and do miracles for children and adults. In 2011 one of these families - of the first young settlers in Medovo - travelled to Herghelia at the OCI reunion camp. Before that time they had spent much time in prayer asking God about His plan for their child and their service. They were asking where should God's children live. When they were in Herghelia they heard a lot of experiences. They met Dr. Moroshan and his wife and saw how God had used them to open an Adventist school – although there were only 4 children in the beginning. But God had blessed their efforts and other families joined the project. Meanwhile some brothers from the USA helped them. At the moment there is a school with 120 children. The school bus travels through villages and cities and the children gather in the school every day. “Let the children come …” Praise God!
<br>
When this Bulgarian family came back home they shared what they had heard and seen in Romania. They reread the message in Selected messages volume 6: “Go out of the cities as soon as possible. Work as earnestly as if you work for your own salvation”. Supported by parents living in the city and ready to send their children to an Adventist school, they started looking for a place for a school. This would be the first Bulgarian school with Adventist teachers who love God and the children. They were going by cars and bikes, praying and looking for a proper place and asking God to show them where is the best location.
<br>
The place should be peaceful, beautiful and far away from the big city. Finally they saw a place at the end of their village – 7000 square meters – a land surrounded by mountains and hills, fields and forest, streams and rivers. The place had all the right features.
<br>
And then the authorities said that the land belongs to the municipality and unless the people give their permission, it couldn't be sold. That was a challenge, but God says: “The battle is mine”. After a lot of praying to God all the local people agreed for the place to be sold. Praise God!
<br>
The next challenge was that we needed to pay 1000 euros just to participate in the auction, but we only had 250 euros. God provided for this need not through friends, but through a stranger.
<br>
Then the richest man in the land said that he wants to buy the place for himself. We started praying again and asking God if it is His will that He may open the doors, and if not – that He may close the doors. After not many days the rich man came to us and said: “Take it, I'm not going to compete with you.”
<br>
So the day came and we went to the auction and indeed we were the only ones there. And now the bigger “mountain” came in sight - the total price was 12,500 euros  and we had to pay the remaining 11,000 euros in 30 days – and we didn't have any money. We decided to sell a small apartment in the city and use the money for this. But this wouldn't happen as quickly as needed. So we prayed if it is God's will that He will move brothers and sisters to lend us the sum until we sell the apartment. But the days flew and when the last day came we only had 3000 euros. On the last day God moved some people and the sum we gathered rouse to 9000 euros. Yet it was 5 PM and were lacking not 2 euros, but 2000 euros! And then the GSM rang and a friend asked: “How much do you have? As a sister just gave 2000 euros and I'm brining those right now...”. Praise the Lord!
<br>
We headed to the bank in the last minute. The person working there was hesitant to stay and make the transaction as it was the end of his working time. But when she heard our story she agreed to do it.
<br>
Now we had to give back the money and come up with a building project. God had a perfect plan for both of these, but we didn't know it.
<br>
We couldn't sell our apartment in the city for almost a year but the people who lent us the money were very patient though this was a test of their patience.
<br>
We faced challenges with the building project as well. God moved some brothers to finance it. But the enemy is not asleep and the project was decidedly rejected in the municipality. We didn't have the money to pay for the corrections in the project. We were out ouf options; but God says: “I am the Lord and there is no other.”
<br>
After 3 months the architect surpisingly called me by the phone and told me that the project is corrected and is now approved! I told him that we don't have the money to pay him, but he said “That's OK. I don't want to be paid for this.”
<br>
Soon after our property was sold and we gave back to our brothers their money. With the rest of the sum – about 7500 euros we started the construction of the building. The capacity would be 40 children – separated by 8 in a class, so it would have 5 classrooms, a teachers' room, a director's room, a physician's room, a kitchen, a gym and a place to eat.
<br>
During the summer of 2013 about 20 people were working on it together – under the bloodstained banner of Emanuel. I think God was very happy at the time! Most of us were from the local church. Some families opened their homes to accommodate the volunteers from the other places. One family prepared the food, another one provided the electricity. Professionals builders also came to help. God had prepared everything!
<br>
It wasn't without difficulties though - it was very hot, we didn't have water in some homes, but nobody complained. An elder brother who had worked on ships was especially helpful and he was encouraging all of us with his positiveness. Two times metal poles fell right near him, but God protected him – and we thank Him! “Do not be afraid for I am with you!” Isaiah 41:10.
<br>
And so after a month of intensive work 15 tons of metal was put in place – the skeleton of the building was ready.
<br>
Then a long period of inactivity came – for 12 months we had no money. Our prayers were “Lord, you started this work – You finish it! We are nothing without You!” Psalm 34:5. And “they looked to Him and their eyes were lit up; and the faces will never be ashamed.”
<br>
One evening the person who had bought our city property called us and said: “I heard that you are selling your other apartment? I want to buy it.” We rejoiced in the news. But then he and the notary quarrelled about the notary taxes and he decided not to buy. We were surprised. And we prayed again. A few days later the buyer called us and said that although he won't gain anything he will still buy it. God answered our prayers again!
<br>
We now had funds and in the spring of 2015 we continued building the school. Meanwhile God had moved some more young families to leave the cities and come to live in the area of the school. They also started helping in the building. Other people from around the contry also volunteered to help. From the youngest – like the teenager who hopes his little brothers may study here – to the oldest – like the elderly brother at the age of 83 who worked daily with us.
<br>
Now we have the roof finished and are working on the ceiling and the walls. But in the beginning of November 2015 we realized that we are almost out of funds again. We prayed earnestly. „I will lift my eyes to the hills where my help will come from. My help is from the Lord who created the heavens and the earth.“ And on the very next day we got 2 calls from abroad, thousand miles away. Some brothers wanted to help us with funds. Who told them of our need? Who moved them to donate? It was God!
<br>
The same God who shortly after that motivated another person to tell me: „We need to pull over and talk about something.“ I said „Can't we talk while driving?“ He said „I see your car has served you faithfully for the last 10 years. But it has aged a lot and weared away. I want to give you 1000 euros to get yourself a new car. And I would give you more if I had, but I don't have more.“ I was out of words. I pulled over the old Opel. I felt the mercy and forgiveness of God in such a measure in spite of our own unworthyness. What a love! Glory be to His name!
<br>
We encourage you, brothers and sisters everywhere, to arise and build for the Lord in your local communities! For God will work with you as He is working with us! Amen!
